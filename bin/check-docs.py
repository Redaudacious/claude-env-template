    moves two kinds of mistake into silence, and the checks here bring them to light:

    ⚠ A test without the bit never runs, and nothing says so. When the rule was put in,
      TWELVE of 49 files lacked the bit — among them a test that was already running in
      the suite and two that had never run.

    ⚠ A test with the bit but without a shebang is taken by the kernel and given to
      `/bin/sh`, which reads Python as shell and BLOCKS reading its input. It does not
      crash — it waits. It cost two runs of ten minutes cut by `timeout`, on the day the
      rule was put in.

    ⚠ A TARGET that falls by default on the INSTALLED path makes the test able to run only
      on the machine that has the tool installed; on the rest it fails, and that failure
      looks identical to a real defect. That is how five broken tests hid inside a number
      the documentation declared normal. The target comes from `TESTS_ROOT`, with an
      optional argument that moves the installed one.

    ⚠ IT LOOKS FOR THE ASSIGNMENT, NOT THE MENTION, and the distinction is what makes the
      rule usable. A test is allowed to write `/usr/local` as much as it likes: it
      fabricates a `$T/r/usr/local/bin` tree to probe a migration, looks for the string in
      the tool's text, or asks whether the installed library exists to know whether it has
      to set up a mount. The first writing of the rule caught all of these — eight files,
      all innocent — and would have been turned off the same day.
