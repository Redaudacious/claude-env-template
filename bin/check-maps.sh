# Runs the verification commands from every IMPACT.md under the root.

# The format is the table in template/IMPACT.md: the fourth column is a command that
# must exit with 0 if the row is still true. The command runs with the folder of the
# IMPACT.md file as the current directory, so the paths in it are relative to the
# project.
#
# A command that exits with 77 is SKIPPED, not failed, by the same convention as the
# `test` collector: a check that cannot run on this machine says so and does not keep
# the map red.
#
# A literal `|` in a command is written `\|`, as the markdown table requires anyway.
#
# The commands come from files of the repository, written by us; `eval` is appropriate
# here and would not be if the source came from outside.
